# tctc-mcp — Design Specification (v1)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes ERC-7303
token-controlled roles to AI agents and their human principals.

- **Agent side (read-only):** an agent can ask *"do I hold the role
  required for this action?"* before attempting it.
- **Principal side (admin):** a human (or supervising agent) can grant
  and revoke an agent's roles by minting/burning control tokens.
- **ERC-8004 bridge:** resolve an `agentId` to its owner, `agentWallet`,
  and ERC-6551 Token Bound Account, so permissions can be bound to the
  agent's identity NFT rather than a rotating wallet
  (see [CONCEPT.md](./CONCEPT.md) §3.2).

v1 is deliberately **config-driven**: the role → control-token mapping
is supplied in a config file, because ERC-7303 contracts do not yet
expose an on-chain introspection interface. The friction documented
while building v1 feeds the ERC-7303 interface proposal
([CONCEPT.md](./CONCEPT.md) §4.1); v2 replaces config with on-chain
auto-discovery.

| Item | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (Node ≥ 20) | MCP SDK maturity; ecosystem reach |
| MCP SDK | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | official |
| Chain access | `viem` | typed, light, multi-chain |
| Transport | stdio (v1) | works in Claude Code / Desktop out of the box; Streamable HTTP is a v2 option |
| Package | `tctc-mcp` on npm, runnable via `npx tctc-mcp` | zero-install onboarding |

### Operating modes

The server runs in one of two modes, decided at startup:

- **read-only** — no signer configured. Only query tools are
  registered; state-changing tools are not exposed at all (an agent
  cannot even attempt them).
- **admin** — a signer is configured via the `TCTC_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`
  environment variable (never via the config file). Grant/revoke tools
  are registered in addition to the query tools.

This maps to the two personas: the *agent's* MCP config is read-only;
the *principal's* MCP config is admin.

## 2. Configuration

Path given by `--config <file>` or `TCTC_CONFIG`; JSON.

```jsonc
{
  "chains": {
    "sepolia": {
      "chainId": 11155111,
      "rpcUrl": "https://rpc.sepolia.org"        // or ${ENV_VAR} substitution
    }
  },
  "defaultChain": "sepolia",

  // The role → control-token map. Each role has EITHER static bindings
  // ("controlTokens", v1's core compromise) OR a "target" (v0.2+): the
  // bindings are then read from the target contract itself at check time
  // via the IERC7303 getters (ERC-165 interfaceId 0x4ee69337), cached 60s.
  "roles": {
    "DISCOVERED_ROLE": {
      "target": {
        "address": "0xIERC7303Target…",
        "chain": "sepolia",                      // optional, default defaultChain
        "role": "MINTER_ROLE"                    // optional name/0xhash on the
      }                                          //   target; default: the key
    },
    "MINTER_ROLE": {
      "description": "May mint product NFTs on the Example contract",
      "controlTokens": [
        {
          "chain": "sepolia",
          "standard": "erc721",                  // "erc721" | "erc1155"
          "address": "0xControlToken…",
          "typeId": null                          // required iff erc1155
        }
      ],
      // Optional, admin mode: how to grant/revoke on this control token.
      // "args" is a template: "$subject" → resolved subject address,
      // "$typeId" → the control token's typeId; other entries are
      // literals. Defaults to ["$subject"] when omitted.
      "admin": {
        "grant": { "function": "safeMint(address)" },
        "revoke": { "function": "burn(address,uint256,uint256)",
                    "args": ["$subject", "$typeId", 1] }
      }
    }
  },

  // Optional ERC-8004 / ERC-6551 bridge.
  "identity": {
    "chain": "sepolia",
    "identityRegistry": "0xIdentityRegistry…",
    "erc6551": {
      "registry": "0x000000006551c19487814612e58FE06813775758",
      "accountImplementation": "0xAccountImpl…",
      "salt": "0x0"
    }
  },

  // Optional: this agent's own account, used as the default subject of
  // check_role. Either a raw address or an agentId to resolve to a TBA.
  "self": { "agentId": 42 }                       // or { "address": "0x…" }
}
```

Rules:

- `${VAR}` values are substituted from the environment at load time.
- Private keys are **rejected** if found anywhere in the config file.
- A role with multiple `controlTokens` is held if **any** of them has
  `balanceOf > 0` (OR semantics, matching ERC-7303).
- For a `target` role, `check_role` reports the discovered bindings and
  their balances as evidence, but the **verdict is the target's own
  `hasRole()` answer** — the same logic its modifier enforces. A
  disagreement between the two is reported in a `note`.

## 3. Tools

All tools return structured JSON content. Query tools are available in
both modes; admin tools only in admin mode.

### 3.1 `list_roles`

List the configured roles and their control tokens.

- **Input:** none
- **Output:**
  ```json
  { "roles": [ { "name": "MINTER_ROLE", "description": "…",
                 "controlTokens": [ { "chain": "sepolia", "standard": "erc721",
                                      "address": "0x…", "typeId": null } ] } ] }
  ```

### 3.2 `check_role`

Check whether an account holds a role. This is a plain
`balanceOf(account)` (ERC-721) / `balanceOf(account, typeId)` (ERC-1155)
call on each configured control token — no ERC-7303 changes required.

- **Input:**
  ```json
  { "role": "MINTER_ROLE",
    "subject": { "address": "0x…" } }   // or { "agentId": 42 } → resolves to TBA
                                        // omitted → config "self"
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  { "role": "MINTER_ROLE", "subject": "0xResolved…", "hasRole": true,
    "evidence": [ { "controlToken": "0x…", "standard": "erc721",
                    "balance": "1" } ] }
  ```

### 3.3 `check_all_roles`

Same subject resolution as `check_role`; returns the hasRole verdict
for every configured role in one call. Intended for an agent's
session-start self-assessment ("what am I allowed to do right now?").

### 3.3b `discover_roles` *(v0.2)*

Introspect **any** contract implementing `IERC7303`
([ethereum/ERCs#1872](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/1872)) — no
role configuration needed; the contract is the source of truth. Role
names are keccak256-hashed; a 32-byte `0x…` value is used as the hash
directly.

- **Input:**
  ```json
  { "target": "0xContract…",
    "chain": "sepolia",                  // optional, default defaultChain
    "roles": ["MINTER_ROLE"],
    "subject": { "address": "0x…" } }    // optional: also report hasRole
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  { "target": "0x…", "chain": "sepolia",
    "supportsIERC7303": true, "interfaceId": "0x4ee69337",
    "roles": [ { "role": "MINTER_ROLE", "roleHash": "0x9f2d…",
                 "erc721ControlTokens": [],
                 "erc1155ControlTokens": [ { "address": "0x…", "typeId": "1" } ],
                 "hasRole": false } ] }
  ```
  A non-compliant target yields `"supportsIERC7303": false` with no
  bindings claimed (not an error — probing is a legitimate question).

### 3.4 `resolve_agent` *(requires `identity` config)*

Resolve an ERC-8004 `agentId` to its current control structure.

- **Input:** `{ "agentId": 42 }`
- **Output:**
  ```json
  { "agentId": 42,
    "owner": "0xNftOwner…",
    "agentURI": "ipfs://…",
    "agentWallet": "0x…| null",
    "tba": { "address": "0xComputed…", "deployed": true } }
  ```
- The TBA address is computed off-chain from
  `(chainId, identityRegistry, agentId)` per ERC-6551 (deterministic,
  valid even before deployment); `deployed` reports whether code exists
  at that address.

### 3.5 `grant_role` *(admin mode only)*

Mint the role's control token to a subject.

- **Input:**
  ```json
  { "role": "MINTER_ROLE",
    "subject": { "agentId": 42 },      // resolved to the TBA — the
                                       // recommended binding target
    "controlTokenIndex": 0 }           // optional if the role has one token
  ```
- **Behavior:** calls the configured `admin.grant` function from the
  signer account; waits for inclusion.
- **Output:** `{ "txHash": "0x…", "status": "success", "subject": "0x…" }`

### 3.6 `revoke_role` *(admin mode only)*

Burn the subject's control token — the on-chain kill switch. Same shape
as `grant_role`, calling `admin.revoke`.

> The MCP client's own permission prompt is the confirmation layer for
> these two tools; the server additionally annotates them as
> destructive/state-changing in their tool metadata so clients can
> require approval.

## 4. Behavior details

- **Subject resolution order:** explicit `address` → explicit `agentId`
  (→ TBA) → config `self`. Every response echoes the resolved address
  so there is no ambiguity about who was checked.
- **Freshness:** `check_role` results are read live; an optional
  in-memory cache (default TTL 10 s, `--no-cache` to disable) absorbs
  bursts. Revocation latency tolerance belongs to the *caller's*
  security model, so the TTL is deliberately short and documented.
- **Errors** are returned as MCP tool errors with stable codes:
  `ROLE_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `CHAIN_UNAVAILABLE`, `SUBJECT_UNRESOLVED`,
  `NOT_ADMIN_MODE`, `TX_REVERTED` (with revert reason when decodable).
- **No custody surprises:** the server never generates keys, never
  persists keys, and in read-only mode performs no signing at all.

## 5. Security considerations

1. **Admin key scope.** The signer only needs mint/burn authority on
   the control-token contracts — it should be a dedicated issuer key,
   not the principal's main wallet.
2. **Check ≠ enforcement.** `check_role` is advisory UX for the agent;
   the *enforcing* check is the ERC-7303 modifier on-chain. A malicious
   agent skipping `check_role` gains nothing — its transaction reverts.
   Documentation must state this explicitly to avoid the server being
   mistaken for a policy enforcement point.
3. **Config integrity.** The role map is trusted input; a tampered
   config could point `check_role` at the wrong token. v2's on-chain
   auto-discovery (below) removes this trust dependency.
4. **Read-only by default.** Absence of the env key not only disables
   admin tools but never registers them, minimizing prompt-injection
   surface on the agent side.
5. **Observed friction on the existing Sepolia deployment** (recorded
   here as evidence for the spec updates of CONCEPT.md §4):
   - *No issuer-side revocation.* The deployed `ControlTokens`
     (`0x5E82784b…`) uses OpenZeppelin `ERC1155Burnable`, whose
     `burn(account, id, value)` succeeds only for the holder or an
     operator the holder approved. The issuer/owner cannot
     unilaterally burn — i.e. the kill switch does not work on this
     deployment unless the holder pre-approves the issuer. This is
     exactly why control tokens granted to agents **MUST be
     issuer-burnable** (CONCEPT.md §4.1). *Resolved for the demo* by
     deploying `AgentControlTokens` (soulbound, `burnByIssuer`) — see
     §8 below; the full grant → use → revoke → denied cycle was
     verified on-chain on 2026-07-06.
   - *Invisible role structure.* The role → control-token bindings and
     the target-side role conjunction (`MyComplexToken.safeMint`
     requires MINTER_ROLE **and** MEMBER_ROLE via two modifiers) are
     only discoverable by reading verified source on Etherscan; the
     config (and therefore `check_role`) can express the per-role OR
     but not the per-function AND. Both would be solved by the
     introspection interface of CONCEPT.md §4.1.

against `anvil` with the TCTC reference contracts deployed in-test;
one live smoke test against the existing Sepolia deployment (manual /
CI-optional).

## 7. Roadmap

- **v1 (this spec):** config-driven; query + admin tools; ERC-8004/6551
  resolution; Sepolia example config.
- **v1.1:** expiry awareness — if a control token exposes an expiry
  interface (ERC-5643-style), report `expiresAt` in `check_role`
  evidence.
- **v2:** ~~on-chain auto-discovery~~ **shipped early as v0.2**
  (2026-07-11), once the introspection interface was merged into the
  ERC ([ethereum/ERCs#1872](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/1872)):
  `target` roles read their bindings from the contract via `IERC7303`,
  and `discover_roles` introspects arbitrary addresses with no role
  config at all. The config's role section survives only as (a) static
  bindings for pre-IERC7303 contracts and (b) the human-readable
  role-name → target mapping.
- **v2.x:** tool-gating middleware (proxy other MCP servers' tools,
  allowing calls only while the agent's TBA holds the mapped role) —
  the full "burn the token, the agent instantly loses the tool" demo.

## 8. Demo deployment (Sepolia)

Deployed and Etherscan-verified specifically for this server
(`AgentControlTokens` on 2026-07-06; `TCTCDemoToken` redeployed on
2026-07-11 to implement the `IERC7303` introspection interface merged
via [ethereum/ERCs#1872](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/1872);
sources in [`examples/contracts/`](../examples/contracts/)):

| Contract | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AgentControlTokens` | [`0x12342A7F0190B3AF3F4b47546D34006EDA54eE0B`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x12342A7F0190B3AF3F4b47546D34006EDA54eE0B#code) | ERC-1155 control tokens; **soulbound** (transfers revert) and **issuer-burnable** (`burnByIssuer`, `onlyOwner`); typeId 1 = MinterCert, 2 = BurnerCert; grant = `mint(address,uint256,uint256)` |
| `TCTCDemoToken` | [`0x4C0a78803D47154B9C6F42EC4AEbab2D1C94c97D`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4C0a78803D47154B9C6F42EC4AEbab2D1C94c97D#code) | ERC-721 + ERC-7303 target; `safeMint(address)` gated by MINTER_ROLE, `burn(uint256)` by BURNER_ROLE; implements `IERC7303` (`hasRole`, `getERC721ControlTokens`, `getERC1155ControlTokens`, `ERC1155ControlTokenAdded` events, ERC-165 interfaceId `0x4ee69337`) |

The kill-switch cycle was smoke-tested on-chain: mint MinterCert →
`safeMint` succeeds → `burnByIssuer` → `safeMint` reverts with
`ERC7303: not has a required token`. This deployment embodies the
control-token requirements of CONCEPT.md §4.1 (non-transferable,
issuer-burnable) and is what
[`examples/config.sepolia.json`](../examples/config.sepolia.json)
points at.
